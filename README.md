## Firmware
The firmware is developed using the STM32 HAL libraries in C. The core logic involves:

1.  **Center-Aligned Complementary PWM:** Great for motor control for reducing the Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) since it keeps the switch between phases happened in different timing.
2.  **Injected ADC Reading:** For current feedback, it is sampling the ADC right at the middle of High Side IGBT on state.
3.  **PI Controllers:** To regulate motor speed and torque.
4.  **SVPWM Generation:** Involving the Look-Up Table (LUT) to generate the correct PWM signals for the IGBT gate drivers.

## Theory of Operation
The control system uses SVPWM to reduce THD and optimize bus voltage utilization compared to standard SPWM. The LUT is being used to reduce the computational burden load. It shifted by 120Â° deg between each phase. These vectors are then used to calculate the appropriate PWM duty cycles for the six inverter switches.
